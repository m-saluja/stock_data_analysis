Project Name: Financial Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Description:
In this data analysis project, I collected financial data from two different firms using Python's yfinance library and web scraping with BeautifulSoup. The data included historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports. After cleaning the data to ensure accuracy, I analyzed it to find trends and insights.

Using Python's yfinance library, I retrieved historical share prices for the selected firms. At the same time, web scraping with BeautifulSoup helped me collect quarterly revenue reports from various websites. This comprehensive data formed the basis for my analysis.
To ensure the data was reliable, I cleaned it by handling missing values and outliers. After merging the datasets, I calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) like financial growth rates and return on investment (ROI). These calculations gave me important insights into the firms' financial performance.

Then, I created visualizations using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. These charts and graphs depicted the historical stock trends, revenue fluctuations, and performance comparisons. Through this financial data analysis and visualization project, I was able to identify trends and potential investment opportunities for the two firms. It provided a powerful tool for strategic decision-making and investment insights.
